üìÇ **Practical Implementations:**

| Practical No. | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Data Wrangling I:** <br> 1. Import necessary Python libraries. <br> 2.  Identify and describe an open-source dataset from a source like Kaggle.  <br> 3.  Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.  <br> 4. Perform data preprocessing: check for missing values, provide initial statistics, variable descriptions, and check data frame dimensions.  <br> 5. Format and normalize data: analyze data types, apply type conversions if needed, and convert categorical variables to quantitative representations.  <br> 6. Provide clear explanations of all operations and the data import/reading process. |
| 2 | **Data Wrangling II:**  <br> 1.  Create an ‚ÄúAcademic performance‚Äù dataset for students.  <br> 2.  Handle missing values and inconsistencies using appropriate techniques.  <br> 3.  Identify and handle outliers in numeric variables.  <br> 4.  Apply data transformations to at least one variable, justifying your chosen approach (e.g., scaling, linearization, or reducing skewness).  |
| 3 | **Descriptive Statistics:**  <br> 1.  Calculate and present summary statistics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation) for a dataset, grouped by a categorical variable (e.g., income grouped by age groups).  <br> 2.  Write a Python program to display statistical details (percentile, mean, standard deviation) for different species in the `iris.csv` dataset.  |
| 4 | **Data Analytics I:** Build a linear regression model using Python/R to predict home prices using the Boston Housing Dataset from Kaggle. |
| 5 | **Data Analytics II:**  <br> 1. Implement logistic regression using Python/R to classify data from the `Social_Network_Ads.csv` dataset. <br> 2.  Calculate and analyze the confusion matrix, accuracy, error rate, precision, and recall. |
| 6 | **Data Analytics III:**  <br> 1. Implement the Na√Øve Bayes classification algorithm using Python/R on the `iris.csv` dataset. <br> 2.  Evaluate the model using the confusion matrix, accuracy, error rate, precision, and recall. |
| 7 | **Text Analytics:**  <br> 1.  Extract a sample document and apply preprocessing techniques: tokenization, POS tagging, stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.  <br> 2.  Create a document representation using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).  |
| 8 | **Data Visualization I:**  <br> 1.  Explore patterns in the 'titanic' dataset using Seaborn. <br> 2. Visualize ticket price distribution using a histogram.  |
| 9 | **Data Visualization II:**  <br> 1. Create a box plot showing age distribution by gender and survival status from the 'titanic' dataset. <br> 2. Draw inferences from the visualized statistics. |
| 10 | **Data Visualization III:** <br> 1. Download a dataset (e.g., Iris) and identify feature types (numeric, nominal). <br> 2. Create histograms and box plots for each feature to illustrate distributions. <br> 3. Compare distributions and identify potential outliers.  |
| 11 | **Hadoop Word Count:** Develop a simple Word Count application in Java using the Hadoop MapReduce framework on a local standalone setup. |
| 12 | **Weather Data Analysis:** Process weather data from a text file (`sample_weather.txt`) using Hadoop to calculate the average temperature, dew point, and wind speed.  |
| 13 | **Apache Spark Basics:** Write a simple program using Scala and the Apache Spark framework.   |
